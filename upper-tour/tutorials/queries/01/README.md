# Map Columns to Struct Fields

Let's suppose the database we're working on has a "books" table that was
created like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "books" (
  "id" INTEGER NOT NULL,
  "title" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  "author_id" INTEGER,
  "subject_id" INTEGER,
  CONSTRAINT "books_id_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

We can represent a single item from such table and the fields accompanying it
with a Go struct accompanied by struct tags in exported fields:

```go
type Book struct {
  ID          uint   `db:"id"`
  Title       string `db:"title"`
  AuthorID    uint   `db:"author_id"`
  SubjectID   uint   `db:"subject_id"`
}
```

The `db` field tag will then be required so `upper/db` can map columns to
struct fields.

Please note that:


* Fields and columns must be similar in type (`upper/db` will handle most
  reasonable conversions automatically).

* Fields must be exported, otherwise they will be ignored.

* Exported fields that are not to be mapped can be tagged with `db:"-"`

In the event the table contains a column configured to represent
automatically-generated values like IDs, serials, dates, etc. the `omitempty`
option will have to be added to the `db` tag:

```go
type Book struct {
  ID uint `db:"id,omitempty"`
}
```

This option will make `upper/db` ignore zero-valued fields when building INSERT
and UPDATE statements so they can be correctly generated by the database
itself.
